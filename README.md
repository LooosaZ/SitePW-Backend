This repo is the backend of a webside being done for my college degree.

To do list:
- Comment the code
- Declarate new Schema methods for the remaining attributes
- Add an extra feature (for those extra points, we gotta grind yk)
- Add the database
- Create CRUD methods for all remaining controllers
